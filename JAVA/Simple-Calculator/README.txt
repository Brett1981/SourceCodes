Project Description:
For this project, you need to implement a very basic calculator by using JavaFX GUI and
the String expression function processing functions you did for project 1. The basic
outlook of the calculator is shown as below. You donâ€™t need to make the color or style
look exactly as this example. Feel free to use your own preferred appearance. But it
should contain the buttons and screen as required.
